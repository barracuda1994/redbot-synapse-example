# redbot-synapse-example
An example of [serial-synapse](https://github.com/hlfshell/serial-synapse) and [serial-synapse-socket](https://github.com/hlfshell/serial-synapse-socket) using the [Sparkfun Redbot](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13166). I got it on sale and this seemed like the perfect test platform!

Makes use of CmdMessenger.h, so have that installed as well.
